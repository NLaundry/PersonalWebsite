        <h4>Angular Hates The "Script" Tag</h4>
        <p>
            So here's the deal, Angular doesn't like the "script" tag inside component html files.
            This is a huge bummer, if like me, you want to include git lab snippets or github gists
            which are usually included with a line such as
            <br/><br/>
            INSERT THE LINE HERE WHEN YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THAT IDIOT.
            <br/><br/>
            To get around this, I tried a couple of js related tricks to insert script tags. This worked ...
            about as well as you might expect (it didnt).
            In the end my solution came in the form of a node package called "ngx-gist".
